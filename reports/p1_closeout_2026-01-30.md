# P1 Closeout — 2026-01-30

## Status
BLOCKED — ECR images not published (CodeBuild failed). E2E P1 not executed.

## Blockers
1) CodeBuild build failed: Next.js error `Module not found: Can't resolve 'tls'` (pg import in client bundle).
2) ECR images not published → CFN deploy + migrations + E2E blocked.

## Next Steps
- Delegate NS for orya.pt (Route53) and wait for ACM ISSUED (eu-west-1 + us-east-1).
- Re-run `scripts/build-and-push.sh` after increasing Docker memory / using larger runner.
- Deploy CFN + run migrations + E2E P1; update this report with requestIds.
