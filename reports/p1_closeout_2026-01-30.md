# P1 Closeout — 2026-01-30

## Status
BLOCKED — infra deploy pending (ACM validation + ECR images). E2E P1 not executed.

## Blockers
1) ACM validation pending (NS delegation not set at registrador).
2) ECR images not published (Docker build OOM during npm ci).

## Next Steps
- Delegate NS for orya.pt (Route53) and wait for ACM ISSUED (eu-west-1 + us-east-1).
- Re-run `scripts/build-and-push.sh` after increasing Docker memory / using larger runner.
- Deploy CFN + run migrations + E2E P1; update this report with requestIds.
